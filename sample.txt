A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as an argument
 and extends or modifies its behavior. You can use decorators to add functionality
 to an existing function without changing its code.For data science theory in Python, the key packages to understand are:
NumPy for foundational scientific computing, Pandas for data manipulation,
 Matplotlib for basic data visualization, Seaborn for enhanced statistical visualizations,
 SciPy for advanced scientific computations,
 Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms,
 and NLTK for natural language processing.For data science theory in Python, the key packages to understand are:
