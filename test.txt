For data science theory in Python, the key packages to understand are:
NumPy for foundational scientific computing, Pandas for data manipulation,
 Matplotlib for basic data visualization, Seaborn for enhanced statistical visualizations,
 SciPy for advanced scientific computations,
 Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms,
 and NLTK for natural language processing.
